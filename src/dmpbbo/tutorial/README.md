# Tutorials

This directory contains a set of tutorials to understand the black-box optimization of dynamical movement primitives. 

Jump to any tutorial you like. The recommended approach would be:

To understand DMPs:

1. <a href="functionapproximators.md">Function Approximators</a>
2. <a href="dynamicalsystems.md">Dynamical Systems</a>
3. <a href="dmp.md">Dynamical Movement Primitives</a>

To understand the optimization of DMPs:

4. <a href="bbo.md">Black-Box Optimization</a>
5. <a href="bbo_of_dmps.md">Black-Box Optimization for Dynamical Movement Primitives</a>

To understand how to apply this to a real robot:
