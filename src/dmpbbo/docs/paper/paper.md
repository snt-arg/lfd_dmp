# General overview

Dynamical movement primitives (DMPs) [@ijspeert02movement, @ijspeert13dynamical] are one of the most popular representations for goal-directed motion primitives in robotics. They are also often used as the policy representation for policy improvement in robotics, a particular form of reinforcement learning. `dmpbbo` provides five software modules for the representation and optimization of dynamical movement primitives. These five modules are:

* `dynamicalsystems/`,  various dynamical systems representing for instance exponential decay or spring-damper systems (standalone module).
* `functionapproximators/`, various function approximators such as Gaussian process regression, radial basis function networks, and Gaussian mixture regression (standalone module).
* `dmp/`, implementation of dynamical movement primitives, where various dynamical systems and function approximators in the first modules can be easily exchanged to get DMPs with different properties.
* `bbo/`, implementations of several stochastic optimization algorithms for the optimization of black-box cost functions (standalone module)
* `dmp_bbo/`, applies black-box optimization to the parameters of a DMP (depends on all other modules)

`dmpbbo` provides both a real-time C++ implementation, as well as an implementation in Python for non-roboticists.

`dmpbbo` is accompanied by an extensive tutorial on the motivation for dynamical movement primitives, and their mathematical derivation. 

## Advanced features

Several more advanced features implemented in dmpbbo are:

* Contextual dynamical movement primitives, which can adapt to variations of tasks [@stulp13learning]

* Dynamical movement primitives with gain schedules [@buchli11learning]

* Unified models for function approximators [@stulp15many]

* Covariance matrix adaptation in black-box optimization, which enables automatic exploration tuning [@stulp12adaptive]


## Applications

This library and its predecessors were used in the following scientific publications [@stulp12adaptive, @stulp13learning, @stulp14simultaneous, @stulp15many]. The images below are snapshots of robotic applications where `dmpbbo' was used. And here a list of videos:
