# Building the C++ version of dmpbbo

After having installed the required packages (see below), the simple hand-coded Makefile in the root is used to compile the C++ code. To compile optimized libraries/binaries do `make build`. To have a debug version (not optimized, contains debug symbols, contains real-time checks) do `make build_debug`.

A local install in the dmpbbo root is achieved by `make install` or `make install_debug`. Either will overwrite the output of the other one in `dmpbbo/lib/` and `dmpbbo/bin/`.

# Installing dependencies

To automatically install the packages (required and optional) run the following (Tested under Ubuntu 20.04):

`./install_dependencies.sh`

You can also manually install these dependencies. For instructions see below.
